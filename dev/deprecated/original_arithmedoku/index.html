          Arithmedoku is inspired by the popular puzzle game
          <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen'>KenKen</a>,
          a sudoku-like game with a math twist, invented by Japanese math teacher
          <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetsuya_Miyamoto'>Tetsuya Miyamoto</a>.
          <br></br>
          All of the puzzles in Arithmedoku were written by Jim Bumgardner, aka Krazydad. He calls them Inkies. From
          the Krazydad

          <p>
            This website has been offering free puzzles to the public since 2005. My mission is to provide puzzles to
            under-served groups that need them, including prisoners, pensioners, home-schoolers, hospitals, churches,
            and classrooms. There are currently about two million individual puzzles on the site, and over sixty
            unique varieties.

          <li>Each row and colum contain each of the numbers 1 through 9, no repeats</li>
          <li>Cages are outlined in bold. They usually contain 2-4 squares.</li>
          <li>In the upper left is a result, and an operation. Performing this operation on the numbers in the cage
            must produce the listed result.</li>
          <li>E.g. a cage with two squares and label <span>42 x</span> could contain 6 and 7, since 6 * 7 = 42, but
            not 8 and 5, since 8 * 5 != 42.</li>
          <li>You can note possible numbers in the box on the left. If you've noted every possibility, hit the
            checkmark to finalize them.</li>
